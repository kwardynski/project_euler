# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
     ```1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...```
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```
For this problem I'm going to leverage Elixir's pattern matching, and 
tail-call optimization.

The module EvenFib has three definitions of fib_accumulator/3 which take 3 arguments:
  - value 1 (i.e. fib(n))
  - value 2 (i.e. fib(n+1))
  - accumulator (i.e. the running sum of event Fibonacci numbers)


Clause 1: Pattern match against val1+val2
If val1+val2 exceeds 4 million, return the accumulator. This ensures we STOP once
we reach a value that exceeds 4 million

Clause 2: Pattern match against val1+val2
If val1+val2 is even, add to the accumulator, and move to the next Fibonacci number

Clause 3: No guards
If val1+val2 DOES NOT exceed 4 million, and also IS NOT EVEN, we can assume it's an odd number.
Therefore, we simply move on to the next Fibonacci number and pass through in incoming accumulator.

COMMAND LINE:
iex
iex(1)> c("even_fibonacci.ex")
[EvenFib]
iex(2)> EvenFib.fib_accumulator(0,1,0)
4613732

Solving this problem this way in Elixir is ridiculously fast:
iex(3)> :timer.tc(EvenFib, :fib_accumulator, [0,1,0])
{2, 4613732}
!! THAT'S 2 MICROSECONDS !!
