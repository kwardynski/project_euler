# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:\
     ```1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...```\
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


## Solution:
For this problem I'm going to leverage Elixir's pattern matching and tail-call optimization. Doing it this way speeds up the "recursion" significantly.

The module EvenFib has three definitions of `fib_accumulator/3` which takes the following three arguments:
1. value 1 (i.e. fib(n))
2. Value 2 (i.e. fin(n+1))
3. accumulator (i.e. the running sum of EVEN Fibonacci numbers)


### Clause 1 - pattern match against val1+val2 - see if ceiling reached
If val1+val2 exceeds 4 million (the ceiling specified by the problem), return the calculated accumulator. This ensures we STOP once we reach the 4 million ceiling.

### Clause 2 - pattern match against val1+val2 - see if even
If val1+val2 is even, add that to the accumulator and move to the next Fibonacci number.

### Clause 3: no guards
If none of the previous guards pass, we can assume we've got an odd number on our hands, therefore we can simply move on to the next Fibonacci number and pass through the incoming accumulator.


## Result:
```
iex
iex(1)> c("even_fibonacci.ex")
[EvenFib]
iex(2)> EvenFib.fib_accumulator(0,1,0)
4613732

Solving this problem this way in Elixir is ridiculously fast:
iex(3)> :timer.tc(EvenFib, :fib_accumulator, [0,1,0])
{2, 4613732}
!! THAT'S 2 MICROSECONDS !!
